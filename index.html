                <p>A Korean-born American with an Irish last name and French surname, a love of the German language, and an inability to be defined by any one definition, Jill’s life could be classified as anything but simple. While attending Northwest University in Seattle for her degree in Education, she met and married her husband. They eventually moved back to her husband’s hometown in Billings, Montana to raise her four kids.</p>
